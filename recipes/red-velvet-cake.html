        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Red velvet cake is a delectable and visually stunning dessert that has captivated taste buds worldwide. To create this luscious treat, you'll need to combine the usual cake ingredients: flour, sugar, eggs, butter, and buttermilk. However, what sets red velvet cake apart is the addition of cocoa powder and a hint of vinegar, which enhances its unique flavor profile. The key ingredient, responsible for its iconic crimson hue, is a touch of red food coloring. Once the batter is mixed to perfection, it's poured into cake pans and baked to a tender, moist texture. The final touch is a luxurious cream cheese frosting, generously spread between layers and over the top. With its rich taste and velvety texture, red velvet cake is a delightful indulgence that is perfect for any celebration or simply satisfying your sweet cravings.</p>
