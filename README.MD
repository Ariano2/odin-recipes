In this project we created a homepage which contained an unordered list of links
to the recipes of three dishes (burger, red velvet cake and lemonade).

The html pages of these recipes followed a simple format that had 
* a heading (h1 tag)
* An image of the dish (using relative links and width set to 300 pixels)
* a description heading and a subsequent description (h2 and p tags)
* heading of Recipe and Ingredients used (h3)
* The list of recipe and ingredients use ol and ul tags respectively (li used for list members)

Each page was linked to home page using list and anchor tags. The anchor
tags use rel attribute (value: noopener noreferrer) and target attribute (value: _blank)
